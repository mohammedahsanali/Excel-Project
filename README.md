In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Fitbit potential customer analysis to identify potential leads for various wellness plans. Leveraging my skills in advanced Excel, VBA programming, dynamic dashboard creation, and problem-solving, I extracted valuable insights from heart rate, weight, and daily activity data. The primary focus was on three distinct plans: weight loss, heart rate maintenance, and healthy sleep improvement. By analyzing user-specific data, including heart rate trends, weight fluctuations, and sleep patterns, I was able to pinpoint individuals who would benefit from these tailored plans.

My expertise in creating dynamic dashboards allowed me to visually present complex data in an intuitive manner. By integrating advanced Excel functions and VBA automation, I streamlined the analysis process and ensured accurate results. Additionally, my ability as a problem solver and finder helped address any challenges encountered during data cleaning and processing, ensuring the reliability of the final outcomes.

Moreover, my strong soft skills facilitated effective communication and collaboration with team members, ensuring a seamless project execution from data collection to insights generation. By merging technical proficiency with interpersonal abilities, I not only delivered a robust potential customer analysis but also contributed to a cohesive team environment.
